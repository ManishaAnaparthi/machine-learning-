# Linear Regression:

Linear regression is a statistical regression method which is used for predictive analysis.
It is one of the very simple and easy algorithms which works on regression and shows the relationship between the continuous variables.
It is used for solving the regression problem in machine learning.
Linear regression shows the linear relationship between the independent variable (X-axis) and the dependent variable (Y-axis), hence called linear regression.
If there is only one input variable (x), then such linear regression is called simple linear regression. And if there is more than one input variable, then such linear regression is called multiple linear regression.
The relationship between variables in the linear regression model can be explained using the below image. Here we are predicting the salary of an employee on the basis of the year of experience.

Mathematical equation for Linear regression:
Y= aX+b  
Here, Y = dependent variables (target variables),
X= Independent variables (predictor variables),
a and b are the linear coefficients
